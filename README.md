# OpenThought - System 2 Research Links

Here you find a collection of material (books, papers, blog-posts etc.) related to reasoning and cognition in AI systems. Specifically we want to cover agents, cognitive architectures, general problem solving strategies and self-improvement.

The term "System 2" in the page title refers to the slower, more deliberative, and more logical mode of thought as described by Daniel Kahneman in his book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).

You know a great resource we should add? Please see [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute).
